# Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0

Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 is about the lack of progress not only in the gym but in life as a whole.

## Introduction

Ten years ago, Swedish fitness and nutrition guru Martin Berkhan wrote an article that went viral among fitness enthusiasts, where he introduced the concept of "Fuckarounditis" to express his frustration over gym rats lacking progress due to misplaced focus on their workouts. Kjetil Åmdal translated the article into Norwegian, and the term "Kukerundtsyndrom" was born. The article is still available on fitnessbloggen.no and can be read [here](https://fitnessbloggen.no).

In this article, I will build upon this concept and introduce Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0, which I believe is even more important to make the world aware of so we can prevent the epidemic together.

Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 is about the lack of progress not only in the gym but in life as a whole.

## Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0

Based on Kjetil's translation of the aforementioned article, I define Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 as follows:

Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 is a mental disorder characterized by a mediocre life and a complete lack of progress, even with multiple hours wasted each week on life.

Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 typically manifests itself as an unhealthy obsession with smartphones, social media, alcohol, shopping, junk food, Netflix, YouTube, and other distractions. Fears related to physical activity, spending time in nature, challenging work, and deep relationships are other symptoms. Genuine effort to develop oneself is lacking, or is squandered on unproductive activities.

Although we have seen an alarming increase in Kukerundtsyndrom in recent years, the concentration of cases can vary. It is estimated that 90-100% of the population suffers from this condition to varying degrees.

Environment and social networks play an important role in the course of the disease. It is theorized that the disorder stems from a lack of information and counterproductive marketing from giants that profit from consumer capitalism.

Human nature, along with the so-called laziness and complacency genes, helps the disease take root in the body.

Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 is an airborne contagion, spreading as disease carriers communicate with others in educational institutions, on the internet, or in other interaction arenas.

The disease typically manifests in late teenage years but can, however, go undiagnosed for a lifetime. The diagnosis is given by a professional and is based on observation of behavior and bodily progress. Symptoms and preventive measures are reviewed and discussed.

### Lack of Progress

The root symptom of Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 can be characterized as a lack of progress in life.

Has your life improved in recent months?

Have you achieved significant development in important areas such as finances, social relationships, training, studies, knowledge, and skills?

If so, the chances are high that you suffer from Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0.

### Excessive Focus on Ineffective Activities

Excessive smartphone use, alcohol consumption, junk food intake, TV watching, gaming, wasting money, and social media usage are time thieves that not only hinder progress but also make life worse.

In the fantastic book "Optionality" by Richard Meadows, this is categorized as "Bottomless Pit," or activities that can lead to a negative spiral in life development.

> Bottomless Pit: An option with negative asymmetry: The potential upside is small or limited, and the potential downside is unlimited.

### Insufficient Focus on Effective Activities

In contrast to activities characterized as "Bottomless Pit," we have "Treasure Chest" activities.

> Treasure Chest: An attractive option with limited downside and unlimited upside. A positively asymmetric option.  
> - Richard Meadows, "Optionality"

Activities that fall into this category include physical activity, healthy eating, saving, learning, meaningful work, reading, and spending time reinforcing social bonds.

The only "cost" associated with Treasure Chest activities is short-lived, and the training of the ability to make these choices will also pay off in the form of self-discipline, which is transferable to all other choices to be made in the future.

### Lack of Progress Measurement

How can one be sure that they are developing in a positive direction?

By measuring.

How is your physical condition, really?

How is your health?

How much financial capital do you have (assets minus debts)?

How deep are your relationships?

How do you perform at work/studies?

It doesn't necessarily have to be quantified with numbers (although it can be effective in many areas), but conducting a regular "check-in" with oneself in these areas is essential to become aware of where one should put in a little extra effort.

I have good experience setting aside a fixed time each week for such self-evaluation. This has been a very important factor in my own development.

### Kukerundtsyndrom Test 2.0

Are you unsure if you suffer from Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0?

Here are 10 questions you can use as a starting point to diagnose yourself:

1. You do not regularly evaluate your life's development.
2. You do not have a structured plan for your days.
3. You are more focused on the next thing you want to buy than on saving.
4. You think more about the possibility of a one-night stand than a steady partner.
5. You spend more than 15 minutes daily mindlessly scrolling through social media.
6. You do not allocate time for physical activity.
7. You eat junk food more than 3 times a week.
8. You have not set long-term goals to work towards.
9. You idolize celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Dan Bilzerian.
10. You watch TV or Netflix more than one hour a day.

## Conclusion

By extending the concept of Kukerundtsyndrom from the fitness sphere to encompass life as a whole, you have been introduced to Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0.

Hopefully, you have gained a sense of whether you suffer from the syndrome.

If so, I hope you have an honest talk with yourself about whether this is something you wish to live with or if you are ready to do what it takes to get rid of it.

How will you look back on a life if you never rid yourself of Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0?
