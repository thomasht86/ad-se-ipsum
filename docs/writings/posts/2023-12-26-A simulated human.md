Lately, I've revisited the Simulation Theory, which brought about an intriguing sequence of thoughts. 
Thoughts for me are best expressed when I force myself to express them in writing.

## Simulation Theory

## The interesting question
How could we express a human with code.
Genes. 
Neurochemistry. 
Physical surroundings.
Brain State.
Memory (LT/ST).  
Body state.

## The macro perspective
The human agent

The 
Human(t+1) = Human(t)+env
