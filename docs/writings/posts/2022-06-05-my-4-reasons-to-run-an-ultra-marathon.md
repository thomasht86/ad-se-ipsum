# Why Run an Ultramarathon?

Updated: June 21, 2022

This is a question I have been asked several times. It seems distant for many to run for many hours straight. It felt distant for me too, not many years ago.

"Why?" is a question I often ask myself.

It's a question I need to have a good answer to if I'm to undertake races like this.

Knowing the "why" is crucial for accomplishing anything demanding, whether it be a larger goal in studies, career, family, or sports.

It’s about concretizing one's values.

For me, this article is an attempt to articulate why I take on a goal like running distances that seem incomprehensible to many.

## A Step Towards Who I Want to Be

It starts with an overarching picture of who I want to be.

Goals become small tasks in life that will take me in the direction of the person I want to be.

I have a long-term vision of being able to play with my great-grandchildren when I am 100 years old. Of course, there are many things I cannot control that will influence whether that vision becomes a reality. But I at least want to do what is within my power.

Additionally, I want to develop a "Stoic mindset." I want to be resilient, train myself to endure much, and appreciate little. In today’s society, this is something most of us need to pursue consciously. Step outside your comfort zone. Do something that scares you. Learn to appreciate the small things.

> Struggling and suffering are the essence of a life worth living. If you're not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you're not demanding more from yourself—expanding and learning as you go—you're choosing a numb existence. You're denying yourself an extraordinary trip.
>
> - Dean Karnazes, Ultramarathon Man

Long endurance exercises have frightened me for much of my life. It’s something I felt I could not cope with. Something I thought I wasn’t made for.

It has definitely been miles outside my comfort zone.

Moreover, it is important for me to be a role model for my children. I want to have stories to tell that demonstrate that it is possible to achieve great things if one puts in the work and doesn’t give up.

Ultramarathon running matches these aspects of who I want to be.

## The Battle Against Myself

I like to think that we all have an angel and a devil inside us. One voice that is positive and pushes us towards our greatest potential. And a voice that pulls us down, telling us how bad we are and that we will never realize our potential.

The only way to make the devil shut up is to develop deep self-confidence. The belief that you can accomplish whatever you set your mind to. By repeatedly collecting such victories, the devil gradually loses his voice. Then there’s little that can hold you back from achieving what you want.

David Goggins calls this struggle a war against oneself. It may not sound particularly pleasant, but for me, it's a war against the devil on my shoulder. The demon at my back.

Call it self-torture if you like, but for me, it's the torment of the demon, not the angel.

If you want to be one of the few to defy those trends in our ever-softening society, you will have to be willing to go to war with yourself and create a whole new identity, which requires an open mind.

I win a small battle every time I lace up my running shoes and get out the door at 5 AM. It feels good.

## Why (Ultra)Running?

Running is the simplest sport in the world. You need nothing, although a pair of shoes can be useful. It can be done anywhere and at any time. There’s always an opportunity to run.

The reason I chose this goal is also that it is a way to get to know my own body. After many years focused on strength and muscle building, endurance is an area I wanted to learn more about. By setting a goal to become a better runner, I suddenly became much more interested in learning about mechanisms and training philosophies related to endurance as well.

It’s important for me to set goals that can be implemented in a busy everyday life, with work and family, and that positively influence other goals and areas of life.

For me, running is an activity that makes me perform better both at work and with my family.

I get to clear my head, be outdoors in nature and sweat a little.

Sometimes I get into a complete flow.

Sometimes I push myself a notch or two out of my comfort zone.

Sometimes I share the running experience with others.

I have never regretted a run.

## The Inner Dialogue

Have you tried meditating? Just being completely still and not thinking about anything. Quite demanding. The mental aspect of running for many hours straight is comparable. You are forced to let your thoughts flow. You are compelled to listen to whatever surfaces. Things that you manage to push away in daily life are sure to pop up during a long run.

Learning to control the inner dialogue is an exciting challenge.

To choose which thoughts you wish to have at any given moment.

It’s a skill that can serve you well in all aspects of life.

Perhaps it’s one of the most important things one can learn for a good life.

> - Ouch! I twisted my ankle.

> Thought A: Damn, how typical for something like this to happen right now. I should just quit.
>
> Thought B: Good, then I get the chance to test my ability to endure pain. Game on!

During an ultramarathon, you get countless opportunities to embrace what is happening.

## Goals

I will never become a good ultramarathon runner. It would require more time and effort than I am willing to put in. But for me, it's fun to see how good I can become with the time and effort I have set aside.

I am unwilling to set goals based on factors I cannot control.

Placement and time are not relevant.

My race is against myself.

My goal in running an ultramarathon is exactly the same as in the rest of life.

To do my best. At all times.

To make the gap between my current self and the best version of myself a little smaller.

Areté.

## Conclusion

To summarize, here are my reasons for running ultramarathons:

- It takes me a step closer to the person I want to be.
- It makes me better in other areas that are even more important to me.
- It gives me enjoyable experiences in everyday life.
- It provides me with a worthy goal to work toward.

If you find a goal that satisfies these four criteria for you, I have just one question:

What are you waiting for?

P.S. I and 25 others will be running the Hokus Pokus Ultra on Friday 2024/06/22, and in connection with that, I have created a fundraiser to support cancer research. (Another reason for me to complete the race.)

We are grateful for everyone who wishes to contribute!
