This is the third and final part of the article series "Create Your Dream Job."

In part 1, I showed you some exercises aimed at increasing your self-awareness to explore opportunities that align with your unique strengths and preferences.

In part 2, you conducted a creative exercise intended to kick-start the thought process regarding how different versions of your future might look.

In this final part, we will explore how to take the various scenarios you developed in part 2 forward. It‚Äôs time to move from words to action. Nothing happens by itself.

First, you can pull out the 3 life plans you created in part 2. Now it's time to evaluate these.

## Evaluate the Life Plans

It‚Äôs useful to divide this into 4 factors that can be evaluated individually.

### The 4 Factors You Can Use to Evaluate Your Alternative Life Plans

Each factor is explained further below:

1. **Resources**

   - **Time**: Do you have the time required to do this?
   - **Money**: Do you have the capital needed to do this?
   - **Career Capital**: Do you have the skills and experience needed to do this?
   - **Skills**: Do you possess the skills required to do this?

2. **Like Factor**

   How much do I like this life plan?

3. **Confidence**

   How confident am I that I can achieve this?

4. **Alignment**

   How well does the plan align with my values?

Feel free to adjust the life plan if you find in your evaluation that there are aspects of the plan that can change to improve the score on one or more factors.

## Ranking

After you have evaluated your life plans against these factors, the next step is to rank the life plans against each other to determine which of the life plans you can start exploring.

## Specify a Prototype

Now it‚Äôs time to explore the life plans in a bit more depth. The goal is for you to gain even better insight into whether what you believe about the life plan is indeed accurate.

Examples of activities that can be part of a prototype include:

- Reading a book on the subject
- Taking an online course
- Interviewing someone with experience in the area
- Creating a plan for daily practice
- Developing a "reading list" for an extended period

## Execute and Repeat

After prototyping, it‚Äôs time to sit down and reflect.

## A Few Final Words

I hope this article series has provided you with a framework to create your dream job. If you enjoy reading and want a deeper insight into the process on which much of the article series is based, I highly recommend the book "Designing Your Life."

I wish you the best of luck on the exciting journey to create your dream job!
