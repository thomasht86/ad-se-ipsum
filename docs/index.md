# What is this?

This webpage is where I write whatever pops into my mind.

My primary audience is myself - ad se ipsum is "to himself" in latin.

If others find my writings useful - great, but I am not seeking recognition.

## Sample Marimo Notebook

```python {marimo}
# This is a sample Python code snippet embedded in a Marimo notebook
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

radius = 5
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")
```

```python {marimo}
# Another sample snippet
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```
