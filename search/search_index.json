Fears related to physical activity, spending time in nature, challenging work, and deep relationships are other symptoms. Genuine effort to develop oneself is lacking, or is squandered on unproductive activities.</p> <p>Although we have seen an alarming increase in Kukerundtsyndrom in recent years, the concentration of cases can vary. It is estimated that 90-100% of the population suffers from this condition to varying degrees.</p> <p>Environment and social networks play an important role in the course of the disease. It is theorized that the disorder stems from a lack of information and counterproductive marketing from giants that profit from consumer capitalism.</p> <p>Human nature, along with the so-called laziness and complacency genes, helps the disease take root in the body.</p> <p>Kukerundtsyndrom 2.0 is an airborne contagion, spreading as disease carriers communicate with others in educational institutions, on the internet, or in other interaction arenas.</p> <p>The disease typically manifests in late teenage years but can, however, go undiagnosed for a lifetime.

Maybe you measure how much money you have in your account, how much electricity you use, or how you are doing in relation to your budget at work.</p> <p>Shouldn't you also measure the most important thing of all, your progress in life?</p> <p>What gets measured, improves. - Lord Kelvin</p> <p>It is simple: what is measured regularly gets improved. By having a place where you measure your progress in your most important areas of life, you establish a foundation for improvement.</p> <p>If you scolded your 5-year-old because he was slow to get dressed, and you want to be a patient and understanding father (yep, been there), do you think your chances of improving in this area increase without reflecting on it and creating a strategy to do better the next time a similar situation arises?</p> <p>I can promise that the likelihood of improvement is much greater if you reflect on the areas you want to improve.</p> <p>Many of the plans we make for the day also turn out to be difficult to carry out amid the whirlwind of everyday life.

I actually created an app with much of this functionality. ReMarkable can be a good option that allows you to write by hand but converts it to a digital format and stores the material for you.</p> <p>Still, I always return to a completely ordinary, standard notebook.

And difficult. To achieve the benefits I have described in this article, it is absolutely necessary to incorporate journaling as a habit.</p> <p>And changing habits is challenging.</p> <p>My best tip is to do this first thing in the morning after you have brushed your teeth. Set your alarm for fifteen minutes earlier, and you have created the space you need to establish the habit. Preferably go to bed a quarter earlier, as well. This way, you are likely swapping screen time for journaling time.</p> <p>That\u2019s a good trade-off.</p> <p>Another trick is to create a form of \"treat\" or reward that you associate with journaling. For me, it\u2019s my first cup of coffee of the day.

Here is the link: Journal Template</p> <p>Here we see that gratitude, goals, identity, roles, and implementation intentions are included.</p> <p>Additionally, I had a small checkbox for creating small comfort zone challenges for myself.

Here are five ways a period in the military can impact your life.</p> <p>The military brings together people from all across the country and mixes them in a pot, adding predefined values and exposing them to stressful situations. I believe the result of this process is better individuals. Therefore, I argue that a term in the military would benefit nearly everyone. I will explain why.</p> <p>In high school, I did not have a conscious relationship with my own values. I partied, fought, and messed around. I did not know who I wanted to be. I had a sense that there should be \"something more.\" I lacked a clear direction in life.</p> <p>When the time came to figure out what I should do after high school, I was uncertain.</p> <p>I thought, \"I guess I\u2019ll become an engineer\u2026\" because I had always done well in science subjects at school. The path to becoming an engineer was the one society had laid out for me. It was the \"normal\" choice.</p> <p>Fortunately, I wanted something more. I wanted to challenge myself a bit. I discovered the opportunity to get an education in the military and to combine leadership training (officer school) with a bachelor's degree in Telematics at the Cyber Engineer School (now the Norwegian Defence University College).</p> <p>At 19, I showed up at Kjevik Airport outside Kristiansand straight from a festival with a forgotten 1.5-liter bottle of moonshine. Fortunately, I wasn't kicked out.</p> <p>Six years later, a different version of myself left Rena, heading back home to Trondheim after completing school and having been involved with the Submarine Service, international assignments, and the Norwegian Special Operations Forces (FSK). (I was, however, a systems engineer and \"unfortunately\" not a special forces soldier.)</p> <p>I was a more refined version of myself.</p> <p>My time in the military made me a better person.</p> <p>In this article, I will reflect on what I took away from the military, aiming to highlight some of the life-changing lessons the military can provide you. </p> <p>The article draws upon my experience at the Cyber Engineer School, but most elements are common traits that both basic training and other military educations can provide you in varying degrees.</p> <ol> <li>Increased Belief in Yourself</li> </ol> <p>The first thing the military gives you is an increased belief in yourself and what you can achieve. Already as a candidate or recruit, you will push boundaries you thought you had. For me, someone who rarely trained aerobically and lived a hedonistic lifestyle, the thought of marching for several days with a heavy pack without much sleep or food felt relatively distant.</p> <p>Jesse Itzler writes in his book \"Living with a SEAL\" about the \"40% rule\" as the key to mental strength. The \"40% rule\" is simple:</p> <p>When your mind tells you that you are done, that you are exhausted, and that you can't go on, you have really only used 40% of your potential.</p> <p>\u2014 Jesse Itzler, \"Living with a SEAL\"</p> <p>In the military, you learn the 40% rule physically. You think you have no more to give, but time and again, you end up pushing the limits of what you thought was possible.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The limits of what you can do and endure, both physically and mentally, are challenged.</p> <p>You get a glimpse of the enormous potential that lies within you.</p> <p>The potential that lies within all of us.</p> <ol> <li>Character Building</li> </ol> <p>The military's core values are respect, responsibility, and courage.</p> <p>These core values are clearly operationalized as part of the culture. The values influence how people behave. Not all organizations can say the same.</p> <p>The military also promotes many good values beyond the core values. There\u2019s no one in the military who thinks it\u2019s acceptable to get drunk while in uniform. Everyone understands that one should stand up for elderly people on the bus. It is understood that one does not complain and moan even if they are cold, tired, exhausted, and hungry.</p> <p>I believe the military is in a unique position to influence soldiers' values through character building. By adopting the identity of a soldier, one automatically inherits a set of good values. Furthermore, when this identity is reinforced around the clock in a community with others, I think we are onto something that explains why the military is such an effective place for positive personal change.</p> <p>Character strengths are different from personality. They run deeper.</p> <p>\u2014 \"What we see of a person on a daily basis is like the tip of an iceberg. It is when things get difficult that you see what is beneath the surface. When it gets painful, exhausting, and challenging.\"</p> <p>\u2014 Professor Ole Boe, usn.no</p> <p>I would like to refer once more to this test, where you can become aware of your own character strengths.</p> <p>By influencing soldiers' value systems and identities, the military builds character through practice, something civilian schools cannot do in the same way.</p> <p>Professor Janne H. Matlary at the Norwegian Defence University College describes it this way:</p> <p>\"In military training in Norway, but nowhere else, one encounters the term \u2018character building,\u2019 translated from character formation. Without knowing oneself and practicing to act correctly in the war zone, one cannot be a soldier. The military profession presupposes ethically correct actions as a reflex. However, all schooling should involve character building. This is achieved through the classical European educational program, often referred to as liberal arts. Education is, however, not something learned, but rather the right ethical practice to such an extent that the virtues become internalized as traits. One cannot simply read oneself into education\u2026\"</p> <p>\u2014 Janne H. Matlary, \"Not Just Train the Body,\" Aftenposten</p> <p>Character building is about learning to make the right choices. The problem usually lies not in not knowing what the right choices are, but in having to train oneself to actually make them. By practicing making the right choices in demanding psychological and mental environments, one can build character.</p> <p>Is there anything more valuable than building character?</p> <ol> <li>A Solid Physical Foundation</li> </ol> <p>The foundation for all we do as humans comes from our bodies. The connection between physical activity and all measures of quality of life is rock solid. To have the energy to meet life's major challenges, you depend on a solid physical platform.</p> <p>In the military, physical activity is an integral part of all training. It can involve everything from marching in the woods with a pack, hand-to-hand combat training, swimming, and CrossFit, to ski trips on NATO skis, mud trails, and my personal favorite, military obstacle course.</p> <p>You are exposed to a wide variety of ways to use your body, and the chances are high that you will try something here that you otherwise would not have done. For me, hand-to-hand combat training, obstacle courses, and climbing are activities I grew fond of and later tried in some form.</p> <p>Most physical activity in the military is organized in groups. This is certainly for practical reasons, but I also believe this has numerous positive effects on both motivation and performance.</p> <p></p> <p>A tough crew pushes each other to get better.</p> <p>I can still taste the blood from some of the toughest long intervals we did in the military.</p> <p>I started with a jog early in the morning when I was in the military, a habit I have resumed in recent years. I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it if my brain hadn\u2019t remembered all those lovely morning runs I had many years ago and the feeling they gave me afterward.</p> <ol> <li>Friends and Experiences for Life</li> </ol> <p>Have you ever seen how people who have been in the military together act when they randomly meet in town? It\u2019s just like seeing two brothers separated in childhood reunite. It doesn\u2019t take many seconds before guys who are otherwise very stingy with their hugs are hanging around each other\u2019s necks, reminiscing about shared experiences from their time in the military.</p> <p>You get incredibly close to those you are in the military with. You get to know both their strengths and weaknesses in a completely different way than in civilian life. By tackling exhausting challenges together, the bonds formed are extremely strong.</p> <p>You can\u2019t hide your true self during a year in the military.</p> <p>Earlier the same day I wrote this article, I actually had a digital coffee with a good friend from my time in the military. It didn\u2019t take long before we found our rhythm again, and laughter flowed freely while we made plans to visit each other as I do with most I keep in touch with.</p> <p></p> <p>The military fosters a unique camaraderie and will give you friends from all over the country whom you can enjoy life with later on.</p> <p>You have a couch to crash on in most cities in the country if you have been in the military.</p> <ol> <li>Increased Gratitude for the Small Things</li> </ol> <p>I believe in contrasts in life - that we humans need to feel discomfort.

Our brains are equipped with a mechanism that is primarily meant to help us. By worrying about how we would survive the winter, we learned to gather and preserve food. By worrying about how we would protect ourselves from the weather and predators, we gathered in groups and learned to build shelters that could provide us with refuge.</p> <p>The challenges you face in everyday life in Norway today are not of the same nature. Thankfully, not many need to worry about whether they have a roof over their heads or enough food to survive.</p> <p>Thus, your brain finds other sources of worry:</p> <ul> <li>Will the project at work be a failure?</li> <li>What will your friends think of your new jacket?</li> <li>Will your child make enough friends at school?</li> <li>How many likes will I get on the Insta selfie I posted?</li> <li>Will my boss criticize me for not delivering that report?</li> <li>Will it snow tonight, requiring me to shovel snow before work tomorrow?</li> <li>What would happen if I had pursued that exciting business idea?</li> </ul> <p>These are worries that are not as useful for our survival as in times past. They can be a major source of suffering for many. If worries are numerous or strong, they can lead to depression and anxiety.</p> <p></p> <p>Worries consume mental bandwidth that reduces your ability to develop as a person, be creative, and become the best version of yourself.</p> <p>In this article, I will show you an exercise that will help you free up this mental bandwidth.

A prerequisite for this is to realize that you have indeed worried. This is not easy. It means thinking about what you are thinking. It requires stepping back between stimulus and response. It is about being the observer of your own thoughts. It may be one of the most important skills you can learn.</p> <p>The first step is to reflect on worries after they have arisen. Each time you feel you have had a mentally exhausting day, I encourage you to take out your journal and ask yourself the following question:</p> <p>\"What have I worried about today?\"</p> <p>By putting your thoughts on paper, you have come a long way. Then you can begin to analyze the worry.</p> <p>The next question is to rationally assess the root of the worry by asking yourself:</p> <p>\"What is the worst that could happen?\"</p> <p>Most worries stem from fear of something that is really not worth being afraid of.</p> <p>Let\u2019s use the worry \"The project at work fails\" as an example.</p> <p>What is the worst that could happen? Is it likely that you would be blamed or punished if the project fails? If that is the case, would you possibly get fired? If you were fired, what would be the ultimate consequence of that? Would you be able to afford food on the table and a roof over your head? Would you have to give up certain parts of your current lifestyle? Would it really be that bad?</p> <p>Another example:</p> <p>\"I won't get enough positive feedback on my Insta selfie.\"</p> <p>What is the actual motivation behind the need for external validation? Is it really so important to me what others think about a picture? Am I not a good person regardless of whether a group of people who happen to follow me on a social media platform chooses to press a heart on your picture? Do you have \"real\" friends who like you for who you are irrespective of the number of likes?</p> <p>Some worries stem from fear of significant, real consequences that are worth considering measures to reduce the risk of. Others you can \"debunk\" right here, by recognizing that the worst that can happen is actually not that bad. Perhaps it is even a \"blessing in disguise\"?</p> <p>For the consequences you have discovered that you wish to reduce the risk of, the next step is to ask yourself:</p> <p>\"What can I do about it?\"</p> <p>For the project at work, it could be:</p> <ul> <li>Identify and analyze risks that may cause the project not to succeed.</li> <li>Write down what you/your team can do to mitigate these.</li> <li>Share the worry and risk analysis with the rest of the team or your manager.</li> <li>Create a shared understanding of what measures are realistic for you to take within the project scope.</li> <li>Develop a plan to implement the measures.</li> </ul> <p>If you have done this, I\u2019m sure that the worries about both the project failing and getting fired would disappear. (If not, perhaps another job might be worth considering anyway..?)</p> <p>Over time, you will also become able to do this analysis in real-time and quell worries before they manifest in your mind.</p>","tags":["mental health","self-development","worry analysis","stoicism"]},{"location":"writings/2021/03/16/how-to-get-rid-of-worries/#practice-what-you-fear","title":"Practice What You Fear","text":"<p>After you have learned to analyze the sources of worries after they arise, it\u2019s time to take it to the next level.</p> <p></p> <p>Michael Phelps is the most decorated swimmer of all time. His coach would sometimes construct challenges for him during training to enable him to handle unforeseen situations. One such situation was training with broken goggles. This proved to yield great returns. During the Olympic final in the 200m butterfly in Beijing in 2008, exactly what they had trained for happened; the goggles broke and filled with water. Because Phelps had trained specifically for this, he was able to win despite the broken goggles.</p> <p>By practicing unforeseen challenges, you become better equipped to handle them if they arise. The amazing thing is that you simultaneously eliminate the source of worry. By practicing it beforehand, you create confidence that you will be able to handle whatever may come up.</p> <p>This exercise has its roots in Stoicism, with Seneca as a valuable source. The Stoics called this exercise premeditatio malorum, and it consists of visualizing the worst possible outcomes that could happen in the future.</p> <p>\"Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck. The man who has anticipated the coming of troubles takes away their power when they arrive.\" - Seneca</p> <p>This may sound distant, and a natural counterargument against such an exercise would be that it\u2019s just superstitious.

Gradually, I noticed that my dream was increasingly about campfires and grilling. Eventually, I woke up a bit and noticed that the smell of smoke was still there. </p> <p>Had some neighbors lit a fire pit or something? The smell didn't go away, so finally, I left dreamland completely, aiming to investigate where the smell was coming from. I quickly realized that there was danger at hand. There was smoke in the room where I was lying, which is between the room where my wife and our youngest daughter and our 1.5-year-old son were sleeping. I was in the guest room sometimes to avoid being woken up by a hungry baby and breastfeeding. I really didn't have much to contribute on that front.</p> <p>I opened the window to see if I could see anything outside.</p> <p>Suddenly, smoke poured in through the window. Shit! I need to get out. I ran to wake my wife and told her there was a fire. Within 2 seconds, she was up with our youngest in her arms. I ran to get the 1.5-year-old, who was at the back of the house, and dragged him along with me. He was sleeping like a rock, totally unaware of what was happening, and understandably shocked to be picked up in that way. On our way out of the house (to the exit), we ran past our 5-year-old, who was quick on his feet, as always. Meanwhile, the smoke alarms were going off. Three smoke alarms started producing an intense, rhythmic alarm simultaneously, but asynchronously.</p> <p>We ran together towards the exit through our workout room on the opposite side of the house from the bedrooms. At the same time, I dialed 110, and I thought it was good I had memorized the emergency numbers with my 5-year-old.</p> <p>I explained the situation to the operator, who was clear and concise, and got an overview of the situation. They asked me to run around the house outside to gather more information. When I came around to the back in nothing but boxers, I saw that the room below our bedrooms in our basement apartment was filled with smoke, and thick smoke was seeping up along the wall. Back in the workout room with the rest of my family, my wife had gone into the living room (which still wasn't filled with smoke) and grabbed blankets to wrap around the boys.</p> <p>They were still shivering. Probably due to a mix of cold and fear.</p> <p>I managed to find a Swix shirt that was lying in the living room.</p> <p>Then it hit me; our cat, Milo, was indoors. I took the shirt over my mouth and quickly ran back into the bathroom, where the cat was lying on the changing table in the warmth, enjoying himself. I picked him up under my arm and brought him to our meeting point. I was still on the line with 110. Now they could inform me that the fire department was on its way. Shortly after, I saw the flashing blue lights a little ways down the street. It couldn't have been more than 4-5 minutes since I called. Incredible!</p> <p>I stood in the street to signal our location and led the red pickup with flashing blue lights into the driveway in front of our basement apartment and explained everything I knew.</p> <p>Not long after, the whole street was filled with emergency vehicles. Ambulances, police, and fire trucks. Now the fire truck had also arrived and started setting up. All the emergency vehicles were producing an unreal mix of flashing lights. Our calm street was suddenly not so calm anymore. The kids' eyes were wide. Both boys have always been super interested in all kinds of emergency vehicles. Fireman Sam is their hero. Suddenly, there's a whole parade of these vehicles in our driveway. The boys and I were taken inside the ambulance, where they measured our blood oxygen saturation. I had played around with a sensor that measures this at work and knew I should be around 100. I had a clip put around my finger and the number slowly but surely rose to 100. My pulse was at 53. Good. The boys also had completely normal values. The 5-year-old had a pulse above 120, but given the situation, that couldn't be said to be abnormal.</p> <p>At this point, neighbors had understandably woken up and offered us to come inside to warm up. How incredibly kind of them. One of their kids goes to the same kindergarten as ours. The man of the house wasn\u2019t feeling well after just getting the Covid vaccine. Still, we were invited in, and they served us both food and drink and dressed us in borrowed clothes. The kids settled down on the floor in some blankets and watched a bit of kids' TV on Mom's phone.</p> <p>Time passed, and I got in touch with the incident commander from the police. I got in the car and explained the situation. I started making some hypotheses about what could have caused the fire. We were in the middle of renovation in the basement. Most of the electrical system had been disconnected due to the renovation work. I had an inspection by electricians last week and had ordered a complete renovation of the electrical system. Earlier that day, we had a family over for a viewing. They had 5-year-old twins running around like 5-year-olds do. Were they close to a panel heater? I wasn\u2019t sure. I shared what I knew.</p> <p>Eventually, we understood that we needed to check into a hotel, and we made our way to B\u00e5rdshaug Manor in Orkanger. There we were accommodated and gathered in blankets and beds before we eventually fell asleep once again.</p> <p>Safe.</p> <p>Together.</p>","tags":["House Fire","Safety","Family","Gratitude","Resilience"]},{"location":"writings/2021/03/23/how-to-handle-a-house-fire/#aftermath","title":"Aftermath","text":"<p>This article was not meant to merely describe the situation.

System 1 is responsible for fast, automatic, unconscious, emotional thoughts.</p> <p>What is 2+2? Reading a text. Finding out which of two objects is larger. Happiness 1 can be viewed in the same way. A happiness that arises automatically based on System 1. It is feelings that emerge in the moment.

Can we not just design our days so that we get a little bit of Happiness 1 and a little bit of Happiness 2\u2014and voila, we have created a happy and deeply satisfying life? Unfortunately, it is probably not that simple. There will be several challenges along the way. Enormous challenges.</p> <p>Here are the three challenges that I consider the biggest on the path to more Happiness 2:</p> <ol> <li>You Will Encounter Pain</li> </ol> <p>The first challenge is that we will encounter suffering in our lives. Suffering that we are not responsible for or have control over. In Buddhism, this is so central that it is the first of their four noble truths; Life is painful. We will experience emotions like fear, sadness, loss, and grief. If we do not handle these in a good way, negative feelings can manifest and become part of everyday life. This is dangerous. In its worst form, this can create serious mental disorders. But it is dangerous even in smaller amounts. The reason is that it steals happiness from us. We cannot experience either Happiness 1 or Happiness 2 when we have negative feelings.</p> <p>Suffering and negative emotions steal bandwidth from our brain. For every moment we experience such feelings, we miss a chance to experience good feelings.</p> <p>The tool that has given me the key to reducing this pain and the negative feelings I\u2019ve learned from Stoicism. The Stoics' idea of turning adversity into a positive challenge has been a game changer for me and many I know. Viewing adversity as a source of positive challenge. An opportunity to act virtuously. To love everything that happens. To understand what we can and cannot control.</p> <ol> <li>You Must Put in Effort</li> </ol> <p>Achieving Happiness 2 requires effort. Lisa Straume, Ph.D. in positive psychology, calls Happiness 2 the effortful happiness. To experience this form of happiness, we must strive. It requires hard work. It requires challenging your comfort zone. It requires confronting your fears head-on. It is about battling the dragons you will encounter on your heroic journey. It is about making the most important choice of your life.</p> <p>I believe the key to this challenge is twofold;</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find Meaning in What We Do   The first thing we can do is to tie our work to something larger than ourselves. To view work as meaningful, and something that contributes value to others. This makes us feel that our work is more worthwhile. It will be a significant source of Happiness 2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do Useful Things We Enjoy   When we do something we enjoy doing, for its own sake, we create Happiness 1. I believe we all have useful things we enjoy. Activities that can be a source of both Happiness 1 and Happiness 2. It can be any form of physical activity. It can be creative activities. It can be interaction with others. If we find such activities, and perhaps adapt them a bit, we may discover that they are beneficial. Perhaps because we become more productive ourselves. Perhaps because we give joy to others. Perhaps by creating some form of art that others find joy in. We can discover flow activities that have value for both ourselves and others.</p> </li> <li> <p>We Think It Is Either/Or</p> </li> </ul> <p>Many think of Happiness 1 and Happiness 2 as a dichotomy. As if you cannot have one without sacrificing the other. If we throw a wild party with all the accompanying pleasures, we place Happiness 1 before Happiness 2. We prioritize indulgence. We choose the biggest burger.</p> <p>If instead we prioritize finishing a school assignment that same evening, and feel that we are sacrificing something important to us, we put Happiness 2 in the driver's seat. We prioritize effort. We choose the healthy, tasteless burger.</p> <p>So how can we maximize both Happiness 1 and Happiness 2? I have two suggestions:</p> <ol> <li>The Golden Mean</li> </ol> <p>By following Aristotle\u2019s advice to pursue the golden mean, we can achieve both Happiness 1 and 2.</p> <p>We can be brave without being cowardly or reckless. We can be moderate without gluttony or being an ascetic. We can be ambitious without being lazy or greedy.</p> <p>We can regularly challenge our comfort zone while understanding that some challenges require more training before they can be faced. We can live a healthy and active lifestyle while still enjoying good food now and then. We can achieve fantastic results at work while also having a good family life. We can read self-development books and still enjoy a Netflix series now and again. We can enjoy a beer with friends over Teams once in a while without drinking alcohol several days a week.</p> <p>By following the golden mean, we appreciate indulgences even more when we allow ourselves to enjoy them. We become more sensitive to the feelings of Happiness 1 they give us.</p> <ol> <li>Find Effortful Activities We Enjoy</li> </ol> <p>Is it true that everything that is effortful is a chore? I do not believe it needs to be that way. I believe we all have things we like to do that are productive and have value for others. It can be handicrafts, art, writing, physical activity, or teaching others.</p> <p>By engaging in effortful and productive endeavors that we also enjoy, we can have our cake and eat it too. We can look forward to work every day. We can love Mondays.</p> <p>We can choose a burger that is both healthy and tasty.</p> <p>We can become effort enjoyers.</p> <p>But remember, to enjoy these activities, we must master them. And before mastery comes effort. It does not come without effort.</p>","tags":["happiness","philosophy","positive psychology","eudaimonia","hedonism"]},{"location":"writings/2021/03/24/what-is-true-happiness/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>I hope the concept of Happiness 1 and Happiness 2 can be useful for you.

It might be one of the most important experiences we can have in life, providing a safe platform to become the best version of ourselves.</p> <p>My wife and I have been together for 8 years now, and married for a bit over 3. It has been quite a journey with ups and downs, and we have gone through many phases of our relationship.</p> <p>We are certainly not experts yet. The journey, learning, and development will continue. We have much to work on.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we believe we have reached some points that may be useful for others.</p> <p>We have overcome many hurdles\u2014hurdles that we see many around us struggle with. Hurdles that have caused many to give up. Hurdles that all relationships will face sooner or later.</p> <p>We created a shared vision of a family gathering in 2067, where we celebrate our golden wedding anniversary with the extended family we have built together through our willingness to put in the work required for our relationship.</p> <p>In this article, I want to present the most important lessons we have learned\u2014the keys that have given us the momentum to overcome the hurdles we have faced until now.</p> <p>I don't find it particularly easy to write (or speak) about feelings. It doesn't come naturally. It makes me vulnerable. The instinct is to think about what others might think. To consider the Law of Jante. Who am I to write about such a topic? Yet, I will take that leap. I will do my best given my limited thoughts and experiences.</p> <p>If there is anything I have learned, it is that daring to do uncomfortable things is one of the most rewarding things I can do.</p> <p>I hope something of what we have learned can help you and your (future) partner over a hurdle or two.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd11#1 A Good Relationship Requires Effort</p> <p>The first key took me a long time to discover. Through movies and books, we are led to believe that love is identical to infatuation. This is a myth. A trap.</p> <p>An infatuation gives no guarantees, only a hope for a life forever. Life has shown me that love is more than infatuation. \u2014 Gaute Orm\u00e5sen</p> <p>This myth gives you a false hope. A hope that there is one person out there whom you will get along with so perfectly that you will live happily together for the rest of your lives without putting in significant effort. A hope that the grass is greener on the other side.</p> <p>The grass turns green where you water it.</p> <p>This trap has destroyed many relationships. My wife found this key before I did. Fortunately, she showed it to me before we gave up. I will always be grateful for that. Not every moment is like this. Both my wife and I are far from perfect and must continuously work on our relationship.</p> <p>It is indeed quite logical. Nothing worth having comes easily. A dream job. Freedom. A strong and healthy body. Wisdom. Courage. Love.</p> <p>Yet, it is so difficult. We are deceived into thinking that things come naturally. We seek shortcuts and \"hacks.\"</p> <p>There are no shortcuts. If both parties in a relationship shift their focus away from themselves and to their partner's needs, something magical happens. Instead of being irritated that your partner is not meeting your needs, you can find joy in meeting your partner's needs. It feels good to do good for others, especially someone you care about. If you truly love someone, this is the greatest joy.</p>","tags":["love","relationships","partner","romance","acceptance","self-development"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/03/3-keys-to-a-good-relationship/#task","title":"Task","text":"<p>Take out a piece of paper or a blank page in your journal and reflect on these questions:</p> <ul> <li>How do you want your relationship to look in 5 years?</li> <li>How do you need to change to create this relationship?</li> <li>What specific actions are you willing to take in your daily life with the goal of creating this relationship?</li> <li>How can you support your partner in areas that are important to them?</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udd11#2 An Open Communication Channel</p> <p>The first key is to create an open communication channel. A channel where we can openly and honestly talk about our relationship. We discuss how we want to feel and how we wish to be.</p> <p>If one party in a relationship has unmet needs and goes on feeling irritated without saying anything, it shortens the pathway to hostile comments and generally poor vibes.</p> <p>By establishing an open and safe communication channel, there is room to discuss each other's needs. To listen to one another to better understand each other.</p> <p>If your partner is complaining about the housework, it is likely that there is something deeper behind it\u2014some needs that are not being met\u2014something that cannot be brought up and discussed in the hustle and bustle of daily life.</p> <p>One of the most important aspects of such a channel is that it gives us a space to listen. To listen to understand what is really underlying the complaints.</p> <p>For a long time, I was a fixer. This is still my natural reaction if my wife brings up a challenge or problem with me.</p> <p>Over time, I have come to understand more and more that it is not about the nail.</p> <p>It is about something deeper\u2014something that is difficult to understand without an open communication channel.</p> <p></p>","tags":["love","relationships","partner","romance","acceptance","self-development"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/03/3-keys-to-a-good-relationship/#task_1","title":"Task","text":"<p>Invite your partner on a date to share your thoughts from the previous task with each other. Then, have an honest conversation where both of you present what the other could do best to satisfy each other's most important needs.</p> <p>The 3 most important things you can do for me to help me thrive are:</p> <ul> <li>Perhaps feeling more appreciated?</li> <li>Getting more freedom to engage in flow activities?</li> <li>Having time to be social?</li> <li>Receiving support to explore a new career path?</li> <li>Being allowed to go to the gym?</li> <li>Having enough time to perform well at work?</li> <li>Receiving help on a task that feels stressful?</li> <li>Gaining more sexual attention?</li> <li>Enjoying more romantic attentiveness?</li> </ul> <p>With newfound insights into each other's needs, the next step becomes exciting: What can I do to better meet these needs?</p> <p>This can turn into a playful game where both seek to understand each other better and facilitate the best possible blossoming of the other.</p> <p>One tip might be to set up a weekly mini-date where you review the week and evaluate yourselves as partners: In which areas do I feel I did well this week? What situations could I have handled better? What can I focus on next week to be an even better partner? It is important that this does not develop into a tug of war and become a space for blaming your partner for what they could have done.</p> <p>The key is to give each other insights that the other can use in their efforts to become a better partner to you.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd11#3 Complete Acceptance and Unconditional Love</p> <p>The third key is difficult. It is incredibly easy for us to think that we wish our partner were this way or that way. We have an illusion of how we believe we want our partner to be.</p> <ul> <li>Couldn\u2019t he just be a little more romantic?</li> <li>Couldn\u2019t she take better care of herself physically?</li> <li>Couldn\u2019t she be a little less focused on her job?</li> <li>Does she really need to spend half an hour in the bathroom every morning?</li> <li>Couldn\u2019t she take better care of the car?</li> <li>Couldn\u2019t he do a few more diaper changes?</li> </ul> <p>You need to rid yourself of these desires about who and how you want your partner to be. This is something you cannot control. However, this is not to say that you cannot make requests (within an open communication channel).</p> <p>If you make pleasant requests instead of voicing complaints, the chances increase tremendously that your partner will want to do these things for you.</p> <p>It becomes a self-chosen goal to become a better partner versus an imposed goal. Motivation is infinitely stronger when it stems from an inner desire rather than when others tell us what to do. Most of us feel an immediate aversion when someone tries to tell us exactly what to do. We need to figure it out ourselves.</p> <p>You must accept your partner just as they are right now\u2014imperfect and flawed, with all their quirks and shortcomings.</p> <p>You are both products of your experiences from birth to now. This is what has shaped you. Do not judge each other for the ways you are.</p> <p>Only when you are able to completely accept your partner are you ready to give unconditional love. This is the highest form of love. We must love our partner in the same way we love a newborn. We love the child just as much, regardless of whether it keeps us awake at night. We find joy in this love.</p> <p>You can let go of the desire for how your partner should be and instead love them for exactly who they are.</p> <p>No matter how much they might complain. No matter how much they shop. No matter how little housework they do. No matter what.</p> <p>Love must not be based on behavior. It must be completely unconditional. In my childhood home, there hung a picture that my mom had put up with the text: \"Love me most when I deserve it least, for then I need it the most.\"</p> <p>This is unconditional love. If your partner is in a bad mental state and hurls a snarky comment your way, it's all too easy to get hurt and retaliate.</p> <p>What if, instead, you see this as an opportunity to love your partner all the more? View it as a golden opportunity to do something that might help them feel better.

There, a user could \"nudge\" another to catch their attention.</p> <p>MSN Messenger - Anno 2004</p> <p>The feeling of receiving a nudge was a bit irritating\u2014a combination of a shaking window and an unpleasant sound\u2014but it often resulted in attention being directed to the person who nudged.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a man, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve visited a urinal with a fake fly on it.</p> <p></p> <p>Did you aim for the fly?</p> <p>Me too. In fact, research has shown that this little fly reduced urinal spillage by a whopping 80%(!).</p> <p>Isn't that amazing?</p> <p>What a fantastic example of a small, cost-effective change in the environment that positively influences our behavior without any negative consequences for ourselves.</p> <p>This is nudging in the context of behavioral economics.</p> <p>In 2008, Nobel Prize winner in economics, Richard H. Thaler, and Harvard professor Cass R. Sunstein wrote the fascinating book \"Nudge - Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.\" There, they introduced research building on Kahneman (another Nobel Prize winner) and Tversky's studies about System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking, and the pitfalls we often fall into when making decisions. Many of our decisions are irrational. They conflict with what we would have chosen if we were more aware of our options.</p> <p>Thaler and Sunstein show in the book how we can leverage this to our advantage through nudging.</p> <p>Nudging can be translated as \"dulting\" in Norwegian. A gentle push in the desired direction.</p> <p>In this context, we can see a nudge as a small change in the environment, designed to alter people's behavior without changing the options or incentives.</p> <p>In this article, I will describe some examples of nudging and offer some ideas on how you can nudge yourself to make better choices. Choices that can lead you to a healthier lifestyle, better finances, increased productivity, and improved relationships.</p> <p>I will show you how to nudge yourself to a better life.</p>","tags":["nudging","habits","small choices","behavioral economics"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/14/nudge-yourself-to-a-better-life/#at-the-societal-level","title":"At the Societal Level","text":"<p>Since 2008, nudging has been applied in many areas with positive outcomes at the societal level.</p> <p>Imagine receiving a reminder from the tax authorities to submit your tax return, along with a sentence stating that 97% of the population has already submitted theirs. It\u2019s natural that you would not want to be among the 3% who haven\u2019t submitted.</p> <p>Or picture standing in line at a cafeteria, about to buy a drink. Do you think your choice will be influenced by the placement of different beverage options in the refrigerator? You\u2019re right.</p> <p>By moving soft drinks and energy drinks to the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, sales of those items were reduced, benefiting water and juice.</p> <p>In the UK, they've set up a Nudge Unit that designs and implements nudging experiments aimed at positively influencing people's behavior for the benefit of society.</p> <p>They changed the pension system so that citizens had to explicitly opt out of membership in a pension scheme.

And the best part? It requires no willpower.</p> <p>I\u2019m excited to see how politicians can use nudging to tackle huge problems like obesity (a ticking time bomb) and mental health issues. The potential at the macro level is vast.</p> <p>But what about you and me?</p> <p>Jordan Peterson\u2019s rule six in \"12 Rules for Life\" is \"Clean up your own room before criticizing the world.\"</p> <p>Marcus Aurelius agrees.</p> <p>We must start with ourselves.</p> <p>Our actions are within our control.</p>","tags":["nudging","habits","small choices","behavioral economics"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/14/nudge-yourself-to-a-better-life/#how-can-you-and-i-as-individuals-nudge-ourselves-to-make-better-choices","title":"How can you and I as individuals nudge ourselves to make better choices?","text":"","tags":["nudging","habits","small choices","behavioral economics"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/14/nudge-yourself-to-a-better-life/#at-the-individual-level","title":"At the Individual Level","text":"<p>Each of us makes about 35,000 decisions each day. 98% of these are made by System 1, based on shortcuts, heuristics, or the result of our habits.</p> <p>By making slight changes to our environment, we have the potential to alter some of the choices we make.</p> <p>We can nudge ourselves to exercise more, eat healthier, be more mindful, and save more.</p> <p>These choices can have a significant impact on how our lives unfold over time.</p> <p>The effect of small choices over time is staggering.</p> <p>Nudge Unit chief David Halpern also discusses System 2 nudging. This can be seen as information that enables us to make more thoughtful choices.</p> <p>My article about Taking the Damn Stairs was a System 2 nudge to you. By attempting to describe the symbolic effect of taking the stairs, I hoped to influence you to make better choices. The hope is that the next time you face a decision between taking the stairs or the escalator, this article pops into your mind, engages System 2 of your brain, and helps you make a conscious decision rather than going on autopilot.</p> <p>But where can we start? My personal approach has been to identify areas I want to change and pinpoint small actions that, when done regularly, have the potential for a large effect over time. An action with the potential to become a keystone habit.</p> <p>One such action for me has been keeping a journal. After several years, this action has now become automatic. A habit. But at first, it wasn\u2019t. I struggled for a while with sporadic writing before I could establish journaling as a routine. The key for me was twofold:</p> <p>I placed my journal near the coffee maker so that I would be reminded of the opportunity to write. This was a System 1 nudge.</p> <p>During this time, I read several articles and books on journaling to become more aware of its effects and the most appealing tactics for me. This was a System 2 nudge.</p> <p>After a short period, the choice became more automatic and has since become a well-integrated part of my morning routine.</p> <p>Exercise is another keystone habit I\u2019ve incorporated into my morning routine. By having a kettlebell and two dumbbells readily available in my living room, I make the choice to fit in a quick workout easy and visible.</p> <p>By hanging a weight vest in the hallway by the front door, I give myself a little nudge to wear the vest when, for example, going out with the family, which maximizes the benefits of the outing.</p> <p>Diet is another area where nudging can help us make better choices. By using a shopping list, you can \"protect\" yourself from the nudging done by grocery stores to get you to buy the items they want you to purchase. Have you noticed how sweets are often placed closest to the checkout? This is, of course, not coincidental.</p> <p>Another example is selling fruits and vegetables as snacks.</p> <p></p> <p>Similarly, we can simplify the choice to eat healthily by cutting fruits and vegetables into small, convenient pieces and placing them in a spot that makes them more appealing than other (less healthy) alternatives.</p> <p>An alarm can be a helpful way to nudge yourself. I\u2019ve set an alarm to send my wife a small note during the workday. This was a choice I wanted to make, but I often found it slipped my mind in favor of the workload ahead. With a simple alarm on my phone, I now do this more often.</p> <p>A final area where nudging has been incredibly effective for me is saving. I used to think that I could save whatever was left over each month. That didn\u2019t work out well. There was rarely much left over.</p> <p>By setting up an automatic savings plan on the same day I receive my paycheck, I make the choice to save automatic. It\u2019s happened that I\u2019ve skipped saving one month if I knew I would have additional expenses, but then I had to adjust the automatic setting in my online bank. This makes it much easier to make the choice I truly want. It is now the \"default\" setting that is automatically executed unless I intervene.</p> <p>Here's a list of several nudges that may be relevant to you:</p> <ul> <li>Install plants at home or in the workplace</li> <li>A post-it note on the computer screen about something you want to be mindful of throughout the workday</li> <li>Set a periodic alarm on your phone for something you wish to be reminded of</li> <li>Rearrange your refrigerator so that healthy options are at the front</li> <li>Buy smaller plates (if you want to lose a bit of weight)</li> <li>Set up an automatic savings plan or smart savings using apps like (Dreams or Kron)</li> <li>A fitness tracker (heart rate watch, etc.) that nudges you to move</li> <li>Polar's \"Inactivity Alert\"</li> </ul>","tags":["nudging","habits","small choices","behavioral economics"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/14/nudge-yourself-to-a-better-life/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Nudging can be a simple and effective way to help yourself make better choices.

Your new employer has no trips planned, and you have to grind at the office with a task that is more demanding than you envisioned. Regret.</p> <p>The second mechanism against more options is FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The fear of missing out. Most choices involve trade-offs, meaning one must forgo something to gain something else. With a high number of options, the chance increases that the ones you do not choose have some attractive characteristics that you must give up. If you are going to buy a cabin, it is difficult to find one that is both in the mountains and by the sea. If your options consist of all possible cabins, it is easy to get caught in indecision.</p> <p>The last mechanism arises due to high expectations. As the gray curve illustrates, it is natural to expect a better outcome with increased choices. Think back to a fantastic restaurant experience you had. I bet it doesn\u2019t stem from a Michelin star restaurant, but rather a place where you didn\u2019t have high expectations to begin with. With high expectations comes the risk of disappointment, and a reduced likelihood of being positively surprised.</p> <p>I believe these mechanisms are an important contributing cause behind many mental health challenges that young people face today.</p> <p>So how can we tackle such large, complex choices with an overwhelming number of options in a way that ensures the outcome is good from both an objective and subjective perspective? A choice that one is satisfied with? That reduces the negative feelings associated with the choice.</p> <p>I believe the main challenge is to be satisfied with the choice after it has been made. We can achieve this by letting go of the notion that one must make an optimal choice. It is simply not possible without knowing what lies ahead in the future.</p> <p>We must lower expectations. Be satisfied with making the best choice based on the available information at the time of decision-making.</p> <p>A structured decision-making process can help us with this.</p>","tags":["choices","opportunities","decision-making"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/24/the-age-of-opportunities/#a-personal-decision-making-process","title":"A Personal Decision-Making Process","text":"<p>Many use some form of decision-making process at work. When the Oil Fund decides whether and where to invest billions, thorough assessments underpin the decision.</p> <p>For you and me, it might be just as important to do thorough evaluations to make significant, personal choices. Here we stand alone. It is liberating, but at the same time, frightening.</p> <p>Often, one can advantageously postpone the decision until a later time. You can use the time leading up to a decision point to gather information that supports the decision-making process. But sooner or later, one is forced to make a choice. The alternative is to end up in an eternal state of searching. End up not watching a movie at all. Like a job hopper. Like a burner who never commits to a relationship.</p> <p>With a decision-making process, we can reinforce the confidence that we have made a good choice.</p> <p>Depending on the context and decision, different decision-making processes may be suitable. Benjamin Franklin proposed creating a \"Pros and Cons\" list. For choices with multiple alternatives, the DECIDE model can be helpful. I personally used the process described in the article series \"Create Your Dream Job\" to choose which career path to take in 2016. That decision-making process created a sense of security that I had made the decision to the best of my ability.</p> <p>Often, we can use others' experiences to gather better information about a choice. It is important to be aware of our individual differences and to be selective about the sources we want to draw from. Be cautious about using the majority as a source. Best-selling book lists, the most popular TV series. The most common professions. These can be useful sources of insight, but we also need to listen to ourselves and our own unique voice.</p> <p>A decision-making process gives you the certainty needed that you have made the choice to the best of your ability. This makes it easier to commit. You get ownership of the decision.</p>","tags":["choices","opportunities","decision-making"]},{"location":"writings/2021/04/24/the-age-of-opportunities/#commitment","title":"Commitment","text":"<p>Without commitment, uncertainty will grow.

With effort and time, it will reveal itself.</p> <p>In practice, I find it useful to set a future date for reevaluation of the choice. For a new job, it might be a year.
